## To launch the game:

- If a version number is shown, Python 3 is already installed.
- Otherwise, follow the prompts to install it.

### 2. Start the game

The general rules for how to play Blackjack can be found here: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/
<br>

As some rules for the game can vary, I have specified my choices for some of these below:
* The player may not split an already split hand.
* The player may not double down after splitting.
* When doubling down, the player must take one and only one additional card, which ends their turn.
* Surrendering your hand is not allowed.

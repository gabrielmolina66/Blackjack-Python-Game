The game will be the card game Blackjack, played via user input in a terminal.

There will be a dealer and a single user.
At each decision point in the game, the user will be asked to input their choice of these, depending on the hand:
    - Stand
    - Hit
    - Split
    - Double
    - Surrender?

Questions:
    How much money to start with?
        1000
    Does the user play for a set number of rounds? Or can they leave the table at any time?
        Set number of rounds
    Can the user surrender?
        No
    One deck or two?
        One deck
    How often to shuffle?
        Each round

Crucial Logic:
    Must have a list of cards in a deck (or two). Remove them as they get drawn.
    After each round, display current points and round number.

Steps:
Begin with a set amount of money/points.
Player places bet (must be < current points)
Dealer draws a random card for the user, one for himself (which is shown), another for the user, and another for himself (which is hidden).
Player inputs their choice.
If their total is not over 21, player inputs their choice again.

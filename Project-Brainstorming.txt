The game will be the card game Blackjack, played via user input in a terminal.

To-Do:
    - get sum of hand even when face cards are involved
    - finish get_choices logic
    - finish make_move logic
    - next step in new_round() is to write the dealer's turn

There will be a dealer and a single user.
At each decision point in the game, the user will be asked to input their choice of these, depending on the hand:
    - Stand
    - Hit
    - Split
    - Double
    - Surrender?

Questions:
    How much money to start with?
        1000
    Does the user play for a set number of rounds? Or can they leave the table at any time?
        Leave at any time
    Can the user surrender?
        No
    One deck or two?
        One deck
    How often to shuffle?
        Each round
    

Crucial Logic:
    Must have a list of cards in a deck (or two). Remove them as they get drawn.
    After each round, display current points and round number.

Steps:
Begin with a set amount of money/points.
Player places bet (must be < current points)
Dealer draws a random card for the user, one for himself (which is shown), another for the user, and another for himself (which is hidden).
Player inputs their choice.
If their total is not over 21, player inputs their choice again.
When the player's turn is over, the dealer reveals his second card. If total is under 17, must hit.



What I would like to display to the terminal:

Welcome to the Blackjack table!
You will start with 1000 points.
You can leave the table and take your winnings (or cut your losses)

Type "leave" or place your bet for round 1: (user input)

You were dealt a (card 1) and a (card 2)
You can (options depending on hand). What's your move? (user input)

    (if hit and still under 21)
    You were dealt a (card 3).
    Your current hand is now a (card 1), a (card 2), and a (card 3).
    You can (options). What's your move?

    (if hit and equal 21)
    You were dealt a (card 3).
    Your current hand is now a (card 1), a (card 2), and a (card 3).
    You got blackjack!

    (if hit and over 21)
    You were dealt a (card 3).
    Your current hand is now a (card 1), a (card 2), and a (card 3).
    Bust!
